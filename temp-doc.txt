5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
    cp copies the files selected. In this case ../temp-* . finds three files: 
    temp-average.py
	temp-data.csv
	temp-doc.txt

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
    Because we cloned a directory, so we already had the hidden directory .git

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
    As I've made changes to this file, I'll need to use to save them using git add temp-doc.txt.
    Then use 'git add' to add the changes. 
    Then I can use the command 'git commit' to commit all of the files I've added/modified
